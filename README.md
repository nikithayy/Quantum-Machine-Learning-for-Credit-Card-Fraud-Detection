# Quantum-Machine-Learning-for-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project compares Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) with classical models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and a 1D CNN for credit card fraud detection. It uses PennyLane, Scikit-Learn, and PyTorch to handle imbalanced data and evaluate model performance.
